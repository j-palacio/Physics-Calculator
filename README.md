# Physics Calculator

## Introduction

Welcome to the Physics Calculator! This Python program provides functions to assist physics students in calculating fundamental physical properties. As a physics teacher preparing for the upcoming semester, you can share these functions with your students to support their learning and problem-solving.

## Functions

### Function 1: `calculate_force` ###

Description: This function calculates the force acting on an object using Newton's second law of motion.

#### Usage:
```python
# Example usage of calculate_force
force = calculate_force(mass=10, acceleration=5)
  print(f"The force acting on the object is {force} Newtons.")
```
### Function 2: calculate_energy 
Description: This function computes the energy of an object based on its mass and velocity.

#### Usage:

```python
Copy code
# Example usage of calculate_energy
energy = calculate_energy(mass=5, velocity=10)
  print(f"The energy of the object is {energy} joules.")
```

### Function 3: calculate_velocity
Description: Given initial velocity, acceleration, and time, this function calculates the final velocity of an object.

####  Usage:

```python
Copy code
# Example usage of calculate_velocity
final_velocity = calculate_velocity(initial_velocity=20, acceleration=2, time=3)
  print(f"The final velocity of the object is {final_velocity} m/s.")
```
[Add more functions as needed.]
