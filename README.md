Description: [Brief description of the function and its purpose.]

Usage:

```python
# Example usage of Function 1
result = function_name(parameters)
print(result)
Function 2: [Function Name]
Description: [Brief description of the function and its purpose.]

Usage:

```python
Copy code
# Example usage of Function 2
result = function_name(parameters)
print(result)
[Add more functions as needed.]
